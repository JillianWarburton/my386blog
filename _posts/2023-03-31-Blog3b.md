# Where we left off Last Time....  

I showed how I used BeautifulSoup to web scrape the Country Comparison data from the CIA's *The World Factbook*. I stated I was particularly interested in seeing which countries have the best medical care, internet access, education, and economy, so that I could restrict the number of countries I will research for possibly moving outside the United States. I also stated I would show how to determine which countries had the highest or lowest rankings in the relevant categories.

# Cleaning up the Data

The first step to this process was combining my seven dataframe files into one dataframe file so I can see which countries I have information for. I ended up having a total of 235 countries to look through, with 22 columns from the country name and ranks, values, and date of information from the 7 data frames. I was missing information for several countries that appeared on 1 ranking list but not the other 6 ranking lists- the most data I ended up missing in a column was 58, from missing Gini Index information.

# Determining Which Factors to Consider First  

I want to have a beginning idea of which countries have the best medical care, internet access, education, and economy. I pulled from 7 of *The World Factbook* Country Comparisons to approximate the aforementioned factors:  
* [Maternal mortality ratio](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/field/maternal-mortality-ratio/country-comparison): the annual number of female deaths per 100,000 live births  
* [Infant mortality rate](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/field/infant-mortality-rate/country-comparison): the annual number of the deaths of infants under one year old per 1,000 live births 
* [Education expenditures](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/field/education-expenditures/country-comparison): the percentage of GDP spent on education  
* [Unemployment rate](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/field/unemployment-rate/country-comparison): the percent of the labor force that is unemployed. This comaprison is ranked from lowest to highest  
* [Gini Index coefficient â€“ distribution of family income](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/field/gini-index-coefficient-distribution-of-family-income/country-comparison) 
* [Internet users](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/field/internet-users/country-comparison): the number of users within a country that access the Internet. The CIA notes that counting internet users in a country is not standardized, so could include people who access the internet anywhere from weekly to biannually   
* [Broadband - fixed subscriptions](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/field/broadband-fixed-subscriptions/country-comparison): the number of subscriptions for physically wired connection to the Internet  

Each Country Comparison has 4 columns: the Rank, the Country name, the metric, and the date the CIA last updated that information. The rows were always variable in number, but generally were near 200.


# Conclusion  

In this post, I showed how cleaned the data frames I collected last into one data frame I could use to explore the data.

The complete code and data can be found in [my GitHub repo](https://github.com/JillianWarburton/Country_Data).  

Until then, please comment below if you have any suggestions or questions for me. I would especially love to know if you have any questions you'd like answered via future graphics!
