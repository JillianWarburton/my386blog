# Where we left off Last Time....  

I showed how I used BeautifulSoup to web scrape the Country Comparison data from the CIA's *The World Factbook*. I stated I was particularly interested in seeing which countries have the best medical care, internet access, education, and economy, so that I could restrict the number of countries I will research for possibly moving outside the United States. I also stated I would show how to determine which countries had the highest or lowest rankings in the relevant categories.

# Cleaning up the Data

The first step to this process was combining my seven dataframe files into one dataframe file so I can see which countries I have information for. I ended up having a total of 235 countries to look through, with 22 columns from the country name and ranks, values, and date of information from the 7 data frames. I was missing information for several countries that appeared on 1 ranking list but not the other 6 ranking lists- the most data I ended up missing in a column was 58, from missing Gini Index information.

# Conclusion  

In this post, I showed how cleaned the data frames I collected last into one data frame I could use to explore the data.

The complete code and data can be found in [my GitHub repo](https://github.com/JillianWarburton/Country_Data).  

Until then, please comment below if you have any suggestions or questions for me. I would especially love to know if you have any questions you'd like answered via future graphics!
